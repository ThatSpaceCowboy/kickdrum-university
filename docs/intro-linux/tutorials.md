:::info Important
For users on Windows operating system, you will find that these commands won't directly run in your Powershell.

However if you have followed along the Git Installation, you should have Git Bash installed on your system which essentially allows you to have a UNIX terminal within Windows and execute these commands. So go ahead and use that to execute any command or instruction mentioned in the docs.

If you are hacky and know your way around, you can also explore dual booting a Linux Distro like Ubuntu, Zorin OS alongisde your existing Windows installation. **[Tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-dual-boot-windows-10-and-ubuntu-linux-dual-booting-tutorial/)** ↗

Do keep in mind that dual booting is somewhat risky so make sure you have tried this on a spare PC already and we wouldn't advise doing this on your primary machine right now if you don't know your way around this. We might have a session once you all are in office on how to dual boot properly.
