# Intro

Let's set you up **it should take 25 minutes (depends on your machine and internet ðŸ˜‰)**.

## Getting Started

Get started by **[creating a GitHub Account  â†—  ](https://github.com/join) first**.

If you have it setup already, **AWESOMEðŸ¤©**.

### What you'll need (tools and tech)

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) Everyone's favourite code editor ?

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) Because there's no better tool for collaborating on code

## Checks before launch

Check Git

```bash
git --version
```

If this returns version numbers, Houston is ready for launch !

:::info For Nerds
If you are already familiar with all of these tools, Great!
Feel free to use any other tools that enhance your Dev Experience on top of these tools
for example - Gitlens (a better Git flow right in VS Code), nvm (manage multiple Node Versions) etc.
For terminal enthusiasts - you can explore [Lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit)
<br />
**All of these are optional** and not needed for you to excel in Pre-KDU or KDU by any means. You'll find these across the docs for reference.
