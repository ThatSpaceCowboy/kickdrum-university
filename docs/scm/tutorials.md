### Setup MFA and SSH for Your GitHub Account:

To keep your GitHub account secure, it's essential to set up Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and SSH keys for easier authentication.

- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**  
  Enable MFA for your GitHub account to add an extra layer of security. This will require a second form of verification in addition to your password when logging in or pushing code.

- **SSH Authentication**  
  Set up SSH keys to securely connect to GitHub without needing to enter your username and password every time. This makes working with repositories more efficient and secure.

### Important Notes:

:::danger
**HTTP-Based Authentication**  
While SSH-based authentication is more secure, you can still use **HTTPS-based** authentication for cloning and pushing into repositories. However, this method is not recommended due to security concerns, and you should transition to SSH as soon as possible for enhanced protection.
:::

:::tip
**GitHub CLI**  
You can streamline your authentication and interaction with GitHub by using the official [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/). The GitHub CLI helps automate common tasks, like creating repositories, issues, and pull requests directly from the command line, and is a great tool if you prefer working without a web interface.

### Why Use Git and GitHub?

Git allows developers to keep track of project changes, easily collaborate, and manage codebases across teams. GitHub, on the other hand, provides a hosting service for Git repositories, and it is one of the most widely used platforms for open-source development and version control. By understanding these tools, you will be able to enhance your coding workflow, maintain clean project histories, and efficiently manage your code across multiple devices and teams.
